Hello! My name is Avery Ellis and I am an incoming PhD student in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. I'm broadly interested in political behavior and political methodology, particularly in the context of American politics. Specifically, I'm interested in applying Bayesian methods and utilizing causal inference to understand how citizens form political opinions and change their minds over time, using both experiments and large-scale data.

I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. I received my B.A. in Mathematics and Government & Legal Studies from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. After completing my undergraduate degree, I spent a year and a half in industry, working at Fidelity Investments in a variety of roles, from quant research to internal consulting to data analytics.

Outside of my research interests, I love to ride bikes, ski (both downhill and cross-country), run, and spend time outside. I rowed for Bowdoin as an undergraduate and spent seven summers as a wilderness trip leader, and I'm always eager to explore the world, particularly through endurance sport. Recent highlights include a marathon in June 2025, riding from Boston to Portland, ME in October 2025, and biking around Mt. Fuji in April 2026.
